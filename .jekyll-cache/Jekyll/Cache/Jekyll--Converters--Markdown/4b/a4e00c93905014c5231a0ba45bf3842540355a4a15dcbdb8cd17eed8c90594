I"L<p>Once every year I try to start blogging. Iâ€™ve tried several different solutions but most of my attempts have been using self hosted Wordpress installations. Wordpress is great but it is also a bit overkill. Managing databases, users, plugins etc. is too much for me, I just need a place where I can write my thoughts down.</p>
