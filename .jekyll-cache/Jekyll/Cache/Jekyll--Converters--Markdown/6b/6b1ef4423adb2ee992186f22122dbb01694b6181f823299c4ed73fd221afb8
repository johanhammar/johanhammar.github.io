I"<p>Once every year I try to start blogging. I’ve tried several different solutions but most of my attempts have been using self hosted Wordpress installations. Wordpress is great but it is also a bit overkill. Managing databases, users, plugins etc. is too much for me, I just need a place where I can write my thoughts down.</p>

<p>So, what’s different this time? For starters I will use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and host the blog on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Hopefully this means I won’t have to administrate the blog too much.</p>

<p>I don’t plan to have a comment section, in my previous blogging attempts I have been hit quite badly with comment spam. However, don’t hesitate to contact me. see details below.</p>
