I"–<p>A few days ago I saw a post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/show-hn-til.png" alt="Show HN" /></a></p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/">guy</a> had been writing daily TILs for a year and published them to a <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>The post seems to have gotten some positive traction and I was inspired to create my own <a href="https://github.com/johanhammar/til">TIL-repository</a>. Feel free to fork or open a PR if you find anything that can be improved.</p>
