## What am I doing now?

Partille, January 18, 2025

:factory: Work

Just completed 10 years at Volvofinans Bank, now Ziklo Bank. I have the last years gravitated to Platform Engineering, a field which I find interesting and can impact many.

:books: Reading

I try to get back into reading. It's always hard to get time and I mostly listen to audio books these days. Se my [Books](https://www.johanhammar.se/books/) page or connect with me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5527890-johan-hammar)

:musical_note: Music

I hope this year brings lots of fun and interesting live performances. Looking forward to [Way Out West](https://www.wayoutwest.se) and also the last live performance of Bob Hund. 

:beer: Beer

Last year I went to MBCFI 2024, hoping to go to more beer events.

:sunglasses: Random

I have always been interested in security and would love to get started hacking on IoT devices. 


Inspired by Derek Sivers's [now page idea](https://nownownow.com/about).
