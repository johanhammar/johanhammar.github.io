A few days ago I saw a post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

[![Show HN]({{ site.url }}/assets/show-hn-til.png)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902)

A [guy](https://github.com/jbranchaud/) had been writing daily TILs for a year and published them to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

The post seems to have gotten some positive traction and I was inspired to create my own [TIL-repository](https://github.com/johanhammar/til). Feel free to fork or open a PR if you find anything that can be improved.
